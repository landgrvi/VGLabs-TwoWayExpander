Modules for VCV Rack

TwoWayExpander is an expander module for itself that displays its id, its position, and the total number of modules in the TwoWayExpander group. This is a minimal example of bi-directional module expander communication.
The widget implements the seamless expander behaviour seen in MindMeld's MixMaster & AuxSpander, where the borders and gap disappear as the expander moves into place.
